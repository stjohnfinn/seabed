# Seabed

Seabed is basically just my idea of a better implementation of WSL. Because it uses Vagrant, it should be more easily configurable than WSL.

Currently, it runs on top of VirtualBox, and I've heard Hyper-V gets closer to the hardware. In the future I'd like to support Hyper-V, but I'm developing this on a version of Windows that doesn't have Hyper-V.
